            <td>One-on-One guided research paper. Wrote about the Black-Scholes option pricing model with an emphasis on the math behind it. Introduced the concepts necessary to understand the basis of the model, the derivation of a solution equation, and hand solved for a sample option pricing using the model. Short overview of the relation of the model to the classic heat equation.</td>
