		<p class="Introduction">
		
		Assuming you are interested in who I am, you've come to the right place. I enjoy rock climbing,

		, and working on various projects in python. I can bake a mean apple pie, solve a variety of rubiks cubes, and replace the suspension on a 2008 4Runner. While all these things are fairly unreleated, they each have their own aspect of puzzle solving that I find extremely rewarding.

		<h2>Work</h2>
		<p class="career">
		I am currently titled as a Data Analyst, however my work has involved a heavy amount of data and software engineering as well as business intelligence. I have established myself as the one to go to for report automation and help with python to sql interaction.
			Most of my day is spent working on a project for discovery of new product listings, be it writing new SQL queries, python modules, or improving the ETl pipeline I have in place for the projects performance dashboard. The dashboard for the project is another
			point of confidence, I spent a serious amount of time including a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram">Sankey Diagram</a> to monitor failure flow.

	<h2>
		Projects
	</h2>
	<p>For all my projects I chose to use Jupyter Lab, mostly for the ease of presentation later on and because it seemed like a flexible platform. These projects have been good sources for me to learn new techniques of tackling problems, and learning various other coding related snippets of information. They are by no means perfect, but I think they give some insight to my personal approach to problem solving. I do wish I had a process for receiving criticism or feedback on them, so be forewarned of spelling errors or suboptimal programs. I will try to expand this list as I am able to polish up other projects to a level of readability.
